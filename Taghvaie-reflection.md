Prior to the GPS session I was struggling with add and commit concept
Both add and commit concepts were clarified during the GPS.
I asked the difference between and add and commit. I also asked about when to use fetch and merge instead of push.
Nothing else confuses me about Git.  Just need to practice more.
I was nervous at the begining but ended up enjoying the session and look forward to the next session.
